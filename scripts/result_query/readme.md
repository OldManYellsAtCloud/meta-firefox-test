This script is used to monitor the state of the current workflow, and generate GitHub badges for each separate jobs (GitHub generates only a single summary badge for all jobs) - the badges are displayed in meta-firefox layer.

This script wasn't intended to be used by others - it's a helper script for status reporting only.
